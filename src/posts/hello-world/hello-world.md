After years, I decided to write blog, publish some of my references and renew my website with some cool features. I built this website from scratch with Eleventy and hosted on Netlify.

Yeah! <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a> is my current favorite static site generator. I tried to use Hugo but I didn't satisfied with it.

## Flashback to First years

I created my personal website for the first thime beginning of the 2012. I didn't take care of the project first year. After one year published a few blog post in Turkish. But my smart-ass friend deleted database with one click (lol).

## Today

Here I am one more time! <<Hello World!>> to everyone! I'm planning to write about front-end world and travel.
